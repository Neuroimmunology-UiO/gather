## Installation

### Quick Setup with Singularity (Recommended)

To simplify installation and ensure reproducibility, we provide a prebuilt Singularity image: `GATHER.sif`.

**Before you begin:**  
Ensure [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/) is installed on your system. You can check with:

```bash
singularity --version
```
### Download the Image

The `GATHER.sif` image is available for direct download from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Neuroimmunology-UiO/gather/releases) of our GitHub repository.

Once downloaded, you can immediately run any GATHeR tool from within the container. For example:

```bash
singularity exec GATHER.sif sc_asm.py --help
```

### Conda-Based Installation (Alternative to Singularity)

If you prefer a local development environment or wish to integrate GATHeR into an existing Conda workflow, you can install it via Conda using [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/). This method is platform-independent and works well for users running Linux or macOS with Conda installed.

We recommend creating a dedicated environment for GATHeR:

```bash
conda create --name gather-env python=3.8
conda activate gather-env
```

Once the environment is active, install the `gather` package and its core dependencies from Bioconda and Conda-Forge:

```bash
conda install -c bioconda gather
```

### Dependencies

In addition to the Python-based modules installed with Conda, GATHeR relies on several **external tools** and **R packages** that are required for assembly, annotation, and phylogenetic analysis.  

#### External Tools
- **NCBI BLAST+** — required for sequence similarity searches  
- **SPAdes** — de novo RNA assembly
- **IgPhyML** — phylogenetic inference of B-cell receptor lineages  
- **Immcantation helper scripts** — utilities for configuring IgBLAST/IMGT references  

#### R Packages
- **BiocManager** — package manager for Bioconductor  
- **treeio**, **ggtree**, **dowser** — Bioconductor packages for lineage tree analysis  
- **dplyr**, **ggrepel** — CRAN packages for data wrangling and visualization  

To install these dependencies in one step, we provide an automated setup script:  

📄 [`setup_gather_dependencies.sh`](https://github.com/Neuroimmunology-UiO/gather/blob/main/scripts/setup_dependencies.sh)

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x setup_gather_dependencies.sh

# Run the installer
./setup_gather_dependencies.sh
```


### Prepare IgBLAST and Reference Databases

To assign V(D)J genes and annotate the junctional regions, we rely on [IgBLAST](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/) and reference data from the IMGT database. Setting up the IgBLAST environment requires a few one-time setup steps.

The setup process is supported by a set of helper scripts available from the [Immcantation project](https://immcantation.org/), which can be found in their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/immcantation/immcantation/tree/master/scripts). These scripts simplify the configuration of IgBLAST and IMGT references. You will need the following setup scripts:

- `fetch_igblastdb.sh` — downloads core IgBLAST databases
- `fetch_imgtdb.sh` — downloads IMGT reference sequences
- `clean_imgtdb.py` — cleans downloaded IMGT sequences (optional for some datasets)
- `imgt2igblast.sh` — converts IMGT references to IgBLAST-compatible format

To use these scripts, copy all the tools from the `/scripts` folder in the [Immcantation repository](https://github.com/immcantation/immcantation/tree/master/scripts) into a directory in your `PATH`.

To perform V(D)J annotation and clonality analysis, IgBLAST must be configured with IMGT reference sequences. This setup includes downloading IgBLAST binaries, fetching reference databases, and converting IMGT germline files into a format compatible with Change-O.

For convenience, we provide an automated setup script based on the [Change-O IgBLAST setup guide](https://changeo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/igblast.html). The script handles download, extraction, and configuration of the necessary files and tools.

You can download the setup script from our GitHub repository:

📄 [`setup_igblast_env.sh`](https://github.com/Neuroimmunology-UiO/gather/blob/main/scripts/setup_igblast_env.sh)

After downloading, make the script executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x setup_igblast_env.sh
./setup_igblast_env.sh
```

> **Note:** You can adjust the IgBLAST version or installation directories inside the script if needed. After running it, restart your shell or run `source ~/.bashrc` to ensure the `IGDATA` environment variable is correctly set.

For more details and troubleshooting, refer to the official [Change-O IgBLAST setup guide](https://changeo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/igblast.html).

## Usage

GATHeR supports single-cell RNA sequencing data from technologies like Smart-seq2/3 and 10x Genomics Chromium.

### Merging Paired-End Reads

If your reads are paired-end:

```bash
cat {cell_file_name}_R1.fastq.gz {cell_file_name}_R2.fastq.gz > {cell_file_name}_merged.fastq.gz
```

Then run:

```bash
sc_asm.py --seq_merged {cell_file_name}_merged.fastq.gz --seq_1 {cell_file_name}_R1.fastq.gz --seq_2 {cell_file_name}_R2.fastq.gz
```

### Single-End Data

```bash
sc_asm.py --seq_merged {cell_file_name}_R1.fastq.gz --seq_1 {cell_file_name}_R1.fastq.gz
```
### Output Files

- `{cell_file_name}_merged.unitigs.fa`: Unitigs from the cDBG graph  
- `{cell_file_name}_merged.contigs.fa`: Assembled contigs (transcriptome, GATHeR algorithm)  
- `{cell_file_name}_merged.BCR_algo1.fa `: Annotated BCR sequences (GATHeR algorithm)
- `{cell_file_name}_merged.BCR_algo2.fa `: Annotated BCR sequences (SPAdes algorithm)
- `{cell_file_name}_merged.BCR_contiguous.fa`: Filtered BCR sequences based on the weight and contiguity using the contigs from the both algos.

### K-mer Size

- Default: `k = 25`
- Rule of thumb: `k < read length - 20`
- For short reads (e.g., 30 bp), the feasible k-mer size range is constrained; values between 21 and 25 are generally appropriate, with 27 being a possible upper limit depending on the context.

## Processing 10x Genomics Chromium Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data for Assembly

To assemble data generated by 10x Genomics Chromium single-cell RNA-seq, the raw sequencing reads must first be processed using Cell Ranger, which organizes the output files in the following structure:

```
project_folder/
├── fastq/
│   ├── sample_name_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz  # Read 1: contains cell barcodes and UMIs
│   ├── sample_name_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz  # Read 2: contains the cDNA read
│   └── sample_name_S1_L001_I1_001.fastq.gz  # Index read (optional; used for sample demultiplexing)
```

The list of detected cell barcodes is typically located in:

```
outs/filtered_feature_bc_matrix/barcodes.tsv.gz
```

### Prepare the Data for Assembly

1. Concatenate all R1 reads:

    ```bash
    cat *R1*.fastq.gz > Merged_R1.fastq.gz
    ```

2. Concatenate all R2 reads:

    ```bash
    cat *R2*.fastq.gz > Merged_R2.fastq.gz
    ```

3. Decompress the barcode file:

    ```bash
    gunzip barcodes.tsv.gz
    ```

4. Run the assembly script:

    ```bash
    10x_asm.py --barcode_file barcodes.tsv \
               --r1_fastq Merged_R1.fastq.gz \
               --r2_fastq Merged_R2.fastq.gz \
               --output_dir_name cells
    ```

**Note**: The `--num_jobs` parameter defaults to 8, but for optimal performance, set it to the maximum number of available CPU cores.

## Clonality analysis

After successfully assembling B-cell receptor (BCR) sequences for each cell, the reconstructed heavy and light chains—each saved in separate FASTA files with distinct headers—can be collected across all cells (`Collected_heavy_chains.fasta` and `Collected_light_chains.fasta`) to perform clonality analysis.

Once merged, you can run the `clonality_analysis.py` script to perform V(D)J gene assignment, CDR3 parsing, productivity assessment, and, optionally, clonal grouping and lineage reconstruction.

### Step 1: Analyze Light Chains

For light chains, use the following command:

```bash
clonality_analysis.py --fasta_file Collected_light_chains.fasta --chain light
```

This will produce:

- `light_chains_db-pass.tsv`: a **Change-O–like tab-delimited file** containing detailed annotations of the light chain sequences, including gene calls, junction regions, productivity, and alignment features.

### Step 2: Analyze Heavy Chains with Clonal Inference and Visualization

For heavy chains, you can include additional flags to enable clonal grouping and downstream visualization:

```bash
clonality_analysis.py --fasta_file Collected_heavy_chains.fasta \
                      --chain heavy \
                      --clonal_plot \
                      --run_combined \
                      --lineage_tree
```

This command will generate:

- `heavy_chains_db-pass_clone-pass.tsv`: a tab-delimited file with full BCR annotations **plus clonal assignments** and **constant region polymorphism analysis**.
- A BCR **clonal network plot**, where sequences are visualized as nodes connected by lines if they belong to the same clone (`--clonal_plot`).
- Phylogenetic **lineage trees** of individual clones reconstructed from inferred germline sequences (`--lineage_tree`).

These outputs follow the standard formats used in the [Change-O](https://changeo.readthedocs.io/) framework and are compatible with downstream tools for repertoire diversity, lineage evolution, and visualization.
